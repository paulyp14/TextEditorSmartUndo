Within our src folder, we have two folders for our source code:
1. base
2. tests

The base folder has the code for our implementation of the software, 
while the test folder has drivers that run independent tests on each 
components: model, view, and controller.

We also have other folders such as resources which contains icons 
of the buttons used in our application.
